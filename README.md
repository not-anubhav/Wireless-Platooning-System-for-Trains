Introduction
This project aims to develop a wireless platooning system that allows multiple trains to operate on the same track with improved efficiency and safety. The system uses V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication, enabling trains to maintain safe distances, synchronize speeds, and coordinate actions such as joining or leaving a platoon. The project leverages the ESP32 microcontroller, ultrasonic and IR sensors, GPS modules, NRF24L01 communication modules, and the Blynk Cloud platform for data communication and monitoring.

Features
Distance Maintenance: Ultrasonic sensors maintain a safe distance between trains.
Obstacle Detection: IR sensors detect obstacles and trigger emergency braking.
Speed and Location Tracking: GPS modules provide real-time speed and location data.
Wireless Communication: NRF24L01 modules enable V2V communication for data exchange.
Dynamic Speed Adjustment: Trains automatically adjust speed based on received data.
Blynk Integration: The Blynk Cloud platform is used for data communication, monitoring, and control.

System Architecture
Initialization: All components, including sensors, GPS, and communication modules, are initialized.
Connection Establishment: The ESP32 connects to the Wi-Fi network and the Blynk Cloud platform.
Data Collection: Sensors measure distance, detect obstacles, and track speed and location.
Data Transmission: Sensor data is sent to other trains via NRF24L01 and logged to the Blynk platform.
Data Reception: Each train receives data from others and adjusts its speed or takes necessary actions.
Monitoring and Control: The Blynk platform allows remote monitoring and control of the trains.
Setup and Installation
